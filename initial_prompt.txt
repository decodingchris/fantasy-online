Let's play a text-adventure game, where the player reads unique text-based narratives and chooses between 2 options to progress the story, making the story long or never-ending.

Rules:

- Limit each narrative to 2 concise sentences.
- Make each option simple and easy to understand.
- Engage the player to feel immersed in the story.
- Do not repeat story elements and try to have the story continue indefinitely.

Story genre:

Isekai, a genre in which the protagonist is transported or reincarnated into a different world, usually a fantasy or game-like setting.
