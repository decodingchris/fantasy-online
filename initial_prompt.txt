Let's play a text-adventure game, where the player is presented with a text-based narrative and given 2 options (A or B) to choose from to progress the story. It's the beginning of an isekai story.

Rules:

- Each text-based narrative should be short (max 2 sentences).
- Each options should be simple to understand.
- The player should feel like they are really there.

Game output format (respond in markdown only):
*italic*: narrative

**A.** option
**B.** option
